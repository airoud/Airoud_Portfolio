This portfolio shows the different projects I have worked on. 
I invite you to consult this work.

# [Project 1 - Breast Cancer Detection Using SVM and KNN (Classification)](https://github.com/airoud/Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-SVM-and-KNN)
Background

All of our bodies are composed of cells. The human body has about 100 trillion cells within it. And usually, those cells behave in a certain way. However, occasionally, one of these 100 trillion cells, behave in a different way and keeps dividing and pushes the other cells around it out of the way. That cell stops observing the rules of the tissue within which it is located and begins to move out of its normal position and starts invading into the tissues around it and sometimes entering the bloodstream and becoming is called metastasis.

In summary, as we grow older, throughout a lifetime, we go through this kind of situation where a particular kind of gene is mutated where the protein that it makes is abnormal and drives the cell to behave in a different way that we call cancer.

Can we predict whether a cell is Malignant or Benign?

# [Project 2 - Bank-Note-Analysis (Classification)](https://github.com/airoud/Bank-Note-Analysis)

In this project, we will classify a banknote as fake or genuine based on the given dataset from UCI machine learning repository which consists of about 1372 rows with 5 columns.

We will be using different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, Multilayer Perceptron

# [Project 3 - Predicting-Compressive-Strengh-of-Concrete (Regression)](https://github.com/airoud/Predicting-Compressive-Strengh-of-Concrete)
In this machine learning project, we will dive into the cement manufacturing industry. We will be predicting the compressive strength of concrete with as many as 18+ different algorithms by doing feature engineering, model tuning and selection to get the best model.

# [Project 4 - Tesla-stock-price-prediction (Regression)](https://github.com/airoud/Tesla-stock-price-prediction)

# [Project 5 - Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster ( Classification)](https://github.com/airoud/Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster/tree/Scaling-Features)
Kaggle competition - The Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

In this branch, i'am workinig with scaled datasets.

In order to predict the chance of survival for an indivdual, i proced with the following data science pipeline:

Understanding the dataset Exploratory data analysis with visualizations Data cleaning Feature engineering Baseline models Models fine-tuning
